You responded to Windows Interview App Development

I’m a Windows desktop developer with experience building stable, production-ready applications that rely on true conditional logic (rule-based flows and state machines, not simple show/hide UI tricks). I can deliver a desktop-only interview app with editable questions, real-time updates, autosave/crash recovery, session keys, JSON import, and PDF export, all with a clean, minimal UI inspired by GitHub. I focus heavily on robustness, performance, and maintainable design to ensure reliability during live interviews.

I’d be glad to discuss your logic model and deliver this within your scope, budget, and timeline.

Jan 13, 12:25 PM
I know but I cannot commit to unlimited reviews
if you want you can share some designs so i can follow this - unlimited reviews does not make sense for me as it can conflict 

I have done 490+ projects on fiverr and I have all happy customer but I dont commit unlimitted
We will try to give you the best design and satisfy you

Hey i wrote everything down....

Hi,

here is a clear description of how I want the interview app to work and how it should look.
This is important to me, because this is a clinical interview tool, not a simple questionnaire app.

---

1. Core Concept

- Desktop application built with Electron
- Purpose: structured psychological interviews with full clinician control
- Target use: adult clinical assessments
→ professional, calm, reliable – not a consumer or startup app

---

2. Interview Logic (Very Important)

- All main questions are loaded from external JSON
- Each question can define:
   - question ID
   - question text
   - answer type (yes/no, scale, text, etc.)
   - optional follow-up rules

Follow-ups

- If a user answers “Yes” (or a defined value):
   - follow-ups may become available
   - follow-ups are optional, never forced
- Follow-ups can be:
   - free text input
   - additional structured questions
   - internal notes (not part of the final report)

Manual Control

- I must always be able to:
   - add a manual follow-up
   - add free text notes
   - skip any follow-up
- Follow-ups should feel like tools, not mandatory steps

This is a rule-based interview with clinical freedom, not a rigid decision tree.

---

3. UI Structure

Layout

- Left sidebar:
   - Interview
   - Tests
   - Notes
   - Export / Report
- Main area:
   - one question at a time
   - large readable text
   - lots of white space

Question View

- Question clearly visible
- Answer options below
- Buttons bottom-right:
   - Back
   - Next
- Subtle progress indicator (e.g. “12 / 45”)

Follow-up Area

- Follow-ups appear:
   - as expandable section
   - or slide-in panel
- Manual follow-up button:
   - “+ Add follow-up / note”

---

4. UX Rules

- Keyboard-friendly:
   - Enter = next
   - Tab navigation works cleanly
- Calm, controlled feeling
- No popups, no interruptions
- No forced interactions

---

Editability / Architecture

- Interview content must not be hardcoded
- Questions and follow-up rules come from JSON
- Clean separation between:
   - UI
   - interview logic
   - content

«I want to adapt and extend the interview later without changing application code.»

---

6. Technology Preferences

- Electron is fine
- JavaScript or TypeScript
- Modern frontend framework (React or Vue preferred)
- Local-only (no backend required for now)

---

7. Design Guidelines

- Modern, clean, clear lines
- Light background (white / very light grey)
- One calm accent color (blue or green)
- No neon colors
- No gamification
- No mobile-app look
- Minimal icons, used only where helpful
- More “medical software” than “startup tool”

Explicit No-Gos

- Dark mode as default
- Fancy animationsd 
- Overloaded toolbars
- Hardcoded interview logic

---

8. Design Reference

Visually closer to clinical or medical software, not apps like Notion, Slack, or consumer productivity tools.

---

If something here seems unclear or difficult to implement, please ask before deciding on an implementation.

Thanks.

Best regards
David
